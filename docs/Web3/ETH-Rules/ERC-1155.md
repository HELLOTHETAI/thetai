# ERC-1155
A standard interface for contracts that manage multiple token types. A single deployed contract may include any combination of fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens or other configurations (e.g. semi-fungible tokens).
[reference](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155)

## Interface
Smart contracts implementing the ERC-1155 standard **MUST** implement all of the functions in the ERC1155 interface.  
Smart contracts implementing the ERC-1155 standard **MUST** implement the ERC-165 supportsInterface function and **MUST** return the constant value true if 0xd9b67a26 is passed through the interfaceID argument.

**ERC-1155 Token Receiver**  
Smart contracts **MUST** implement all of the functions in the ERC1155TokenReceiver interface to accept transfers. See “Safe Transfer Rules” for further detail.

Smart contracts **MUST** implement the ERC-165 supportsInterface function and signify support for the ERC1155TokenReceiver interface to accept transfers. See “ERC1155TokenReceiver ERC-165 rules” for further detail.

**ERC-1155 Metadata URI JSON Schema**  
This JSON schema is loosely based on the “ERC721 Metadata JSON Schema”, but includes optional formatting to allow for ID substitution by clients. If the string {id} exists in any JSON value, it MUST be replaced with the actual token ID, by all client software that follows this standard.

The string format of the substituted hexadecimal ID MUST be lowercase alphanumeric: [0-9a-f] with no 0x prefix.
The string format of the substituted hexadecimal ID MUST be leading zero padded to 64 hex characters length if necessary.
