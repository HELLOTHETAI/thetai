# Carbon Credit Market Insights

This category provides real-time data and information on global carbon markets. It currently offers data on the China Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) market. The scope will expand to track carbon pricing, trading volumes, and policy developments across markets including the EU ETS, RGGI, NZ ETS, and more. By compiling data on fundamentals across compliance and voluntary carbon markets, it offers insights into price trends, demand-supply dynamics, emerging offset projects, and overall market growth. This helps corporations and investors better understand the global carbon landscape and opportunities in carbon assets and decarbonization strategies.
